# Pattern-Separation-using-Logistic-Regressions
Collaborated within a team to build a logistic regression for pattern separation and distinguish two disjoint sets within a database. Minimizing log-likelihood using cvxpy and exploring regularization techniques
Deployed logistic regression from scratch and applied the concepts of convex optimization in determining parameters.
